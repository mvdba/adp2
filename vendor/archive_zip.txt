Archive::Zip Object Model

Overview
--------

    - Archive::Zip::Archive objects are what you ordinarily deal with.
      These maintain the structure of a zip file, without necessarily holding data.

    - When a zip is read from a disk file, the (possibly compressed) data
      still lives in the file, not in memory.

    - Archive members hold information about the individual members,
      but not (usually) the actual member data.

    - When the zip is written to a (different) file, the member data
      is compressed or copied as needed.

    - It is possible to make archive members whose data is held in a string in memory,
      but this is not done when a zip file is read.

    - Directory members don't have any data.

Methods
-------

Archive::Zip class
    - invisible subclass Archive::Zip::Archive

    new:
        - my $zip = Archive::Zip->new();
          creates a new empty zip archive

        - my $zip = Archive::Zip->new( 'xyz.zip' );
          new() will call read() to read the existing 'xyz.zip' archive.

    Utility
        Archive::Zip::tempFile( [$tmpdir] )

        - my $rc = $zip->tempFile( '/tmp/work' );

    Zip Archive Accessors

        - my @members = $zip->members();
        - my @members = $zip->memberNames()
        - my $nm      = $zip->numberOfMembers()
        - my $comment = $zip->zipfileComment( [$string] );

    Members
        - my $rc = $zip->addFile( $fileName [, $newName ] )
        - my $rc = $zip->addString( $stringOrStringRef  , $name )
          my $rc = $zip->addString( $readmeTemplate     , 'readme.txt' )

        - my $text = $zip->contents( 'bin/emp.ctl' );

    I/O
        - my $rc = $zip->writeToFileNamed( $fileName )
